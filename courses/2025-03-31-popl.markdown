**Office Hours:** TBA

### Course Description

Syntax and semantics. Compilers and interpreters. Programs as data. Regular
expressions and context free grammars. Programming paradigms, including
procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming. Type systems, including
dynamic and static typing disciplines. Binding, scope, data abstraction, and
modularity. Denotational, operational, and axiomatic semantics. Introduction to
program correctness.

### Prerequisites

CS 302, CS 314, CS 350

These courses provide you with the background that you will need to understand
the course material and develop solutions to the assignments that you will be
given. It is assumed that you have experience programming in a high-level,
object-oriented language (specifically, C++ or Java, from CS 202 and earlier
classes). If you have not completed the prerequisites, then you may not have the
background that you need to pass this class. In this case, by default, you will
not be able to continue in the class and you should contact the instructor at
the earliest opportunity to avoid an administrative drop.
