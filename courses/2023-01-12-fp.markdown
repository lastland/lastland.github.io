**Office Hours:** TBD

**Textbook:** No textbook required.

### Course Description

If you are paying attention to the recent evolution of today's mainstream
programming languages, you will find the emergence of various features adapted
from functional languages. Why is this happening? What is special about
functional programming? Is there something that one can learn from functional
programming paradigm that can make them a better programmer?

In this course, you will learn the key ideas behind functional programming that
make it powerful, via a programming language called
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). I will show you how functional languages
can help you write readable, modular, and efficient code.
