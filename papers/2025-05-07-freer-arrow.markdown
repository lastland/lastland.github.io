Freer monads are a useful structure commonly used in various domains due to
their expressiveness. However, a known issue with freer monads is that they are
not amenable to static analysis. This paper explores freer arrows, a relatively
expressive structure that is amenable to static analysis. We propose several
variants of freer arrows. We conduct a case study on choreographic programming
to demonstrate the usefulness of freer arrows in Haskell.
