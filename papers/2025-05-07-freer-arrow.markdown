Freer monads are a useful structure commonly used in various domains due to its
expressiveness. However, a known issue with freer monads is that they are not
amenable to static analysis. This paper explores freer arrows, a structure that
is relatively expressive and amenable to static analysis. We propose several
variants of freer arrows, including basic freer arrows and bridged freer arrows.
We define an equivalence relation for freer arrows that compares their
semantical parts semantically and their syntactic parts syntactically. Finally,
we conduct a few case studies to demonstrate the usefulness of freer arrows.
