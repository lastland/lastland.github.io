We present a networked key-value server, implemented in C and formally verified
in Coq. The server interacts with clients using a subset of the HTTP/1.1
protocol and is specified and verified using interaction trees and the Verified
Software Toolchain. The codebase includes a reusable and fully verified C string
library that provides 17 standard POSIX string functions and 17 general purpose
non-POSIX string functions. For the KVServer socket system calls, we establish a
refinement relation between specifications at user-space level and at CertiKOS
kernel-space level.
