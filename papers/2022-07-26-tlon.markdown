Free monads (and their variants) have become a popular general-purpose tool for
representing the semantics of effectful programs in proof assistants. These data
structures support the compositional definition of semantics parameterized by
uninterpreted events, while admitting a rich equational theory of
equivalence. But monads are not the only way to structure effectful computation,
why should we limit ourselves?

In this paper, inspired by applicative functors, selective functors, and other
structures, we define a collection of data structures and theories, which we
call program adverbs, that capture a variety of computational patterns. Program
adverbs are themselves composable, allowing them to be used to specify the
semantics of languages with multiple computation patterns. We use program
adverbs as the basis for a new class of semantic embeddings called Tlön
embeddings. Compared with embeddings based on free monads, Tlön embeddings allow
more flexibility in computational modeling of effects, while retaining more
information about the program's syntactic structure.
