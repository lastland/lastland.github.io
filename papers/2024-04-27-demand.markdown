Lazy evaluation is a powerful tool that enables better compositionality and
potentially better performance in functional programming, but it is challenging
to analyze its computation cost. Existing works either require manually
annotating sharing, or rely on separation logic to reason about heaps of mutable
cells. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional demand semantics that allows
for reasoning about the computation cost of lazy programs without relying on
special program logics. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the
demand semantics to a variety of case studies including insertion sort,
selection sort, Okasaki's banker's queue, and the push function of the implicit
queue. We formally prove that the banker's queue and the push function of the
implicit queue are both amortized and persistent using the Rocq Prover (formerly
known as Coq). We also propose the reverse physicist's method, a novel variant
of the classical physicist's method, which enables mechanized, modular and
compositional reasoning about amortization and persistence with the demand
semantics.
