Embedding describes the process of encoding a program's syntax and/or semantics
in another language---typically a theorem prover in the context of mechanized
reasoning. Among different embedding styles, deep embeddings are generally
preferred as they enable the most faithful modeling of the original language.
However, deep embeddings are also the most complex, and working with them
requires additional effort. In light of that, this dissertation aims to draw
more attention to alternative styles, namely shallow and mixed embeddings, by
studying their use in mechanized reasoning about programs' properties that are
related to "how". More specifically, I present a simple shallow embedding for
reasoning about computation costs of lazy programs, and a class of mixed
embeddings that are useful for reasoning about properties of general computation
patterns in effectful programs. I show the usefulness of these embedding styles
with examples based on real-world applications.
