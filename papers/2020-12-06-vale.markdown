Hand-optimized assembly language code is often difficult to formally
verify. This paper combines Hoare logic with verified code transformations to
make it easier to verify such code. This approach greatly simplifies existing
proofs of highly optimized OpenSSL-based AES-GCM cryptographic
code. Furthermore, applying various verified transformations to the AES-GCM code
enables additional platform-specific performance improvements.
