Field Programmable Gate Arrays, or FPGAs, allow designers to implement hardware
designs using hardware description languages (HDLs). This type of designs have
been gaining significant popularity since improvements in clock frequencies, of
high-end CPUs, have started to level off and other alternatives have been
explored to accelerate computations. However, traditional HDLs lack a number of
modern facilities and a rich ecosystem to express and test designs, which
severely restricts the productivity of designers. In this paper, we propose
ScalaHDL, an open-source domain-specific language (DSL) built on top of Scala,
that enables designers to describe algorithms using a multi-paradigm programming
language, and generate the required Verilog code to implement such systems. In
addition, these designs can be simulated so that values can be tested
programmatically using unit-tests. With ScalaHDL, designers can also leverage
the rich and mature ecosystems provided by Java and Scala.
