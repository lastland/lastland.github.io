<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>Despite decades of advancement in software development, software bugs are still
a common phenomenon. In fact, it is becoming increasingly challenging to
identify and fix bugs these days, with new modern technologies such as
distributed systems, microservices, and LLM-assisted programming. What can we do
about this?</p>
<p>Formal verification is a methodology of using formal logic to establish a proof
that shows a program is absent of bugs. The past decade has seen enormous
advances in the verification of important software infrastructure, including
realistic cryptographic libraries, data structure libraries, compilers,
operating systems, and file systems. In this course, we will discuss both
classical and new, cutting-edge approaches in program verification. We will also
prepare you to understand research papers in the field of program verification.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Background in elementary discrete math and logic, e.g., CS 250 Discrete
Structures I, CS 251 Discrete Structures II or equivalent classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A programming language semantics course, e.g., CS410P/510 Programming Language
Semantics or CS578 Programming Language Semantics or equivalent classes, or</p></li>
<li><p>Familiar with at least one theorem prover/formal verification tool, e.g., Rocq
(formerly known as Coq), Agda, Isabelle, F*, Dafny, etc., or</p></li>
<li><p>A proof assistant class, e.g., CS 410/510 TOP: Proof Assistants and Program
Verification or CS410/510 Theorem Proving and Program Verification</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>Upon the successful completion of this class…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I can recognize shallow embeddings, deep embeddings, and (optionally) mixed
embeddings of program semantics.</p></li>
<li><p>I can define functional correctness properties for simple programs using
classical programming logics such as Hoare logic, separation logic, and
incorrectness logic, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>I can describe, relate, and compare classical approaches to program
verification such as forward and backward simulation, Lipton’s reduction, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>I can read research papers on program verification, identify what
contributions these papers make, and explain key ideas of these papers in a
written literature review and in a presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>I can evaluate both the writing and the technical presentation of a research
paper on program verification.</p></li>
</ul>
