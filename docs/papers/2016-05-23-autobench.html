        <p>Researchers often rely on benchmarks to demonstrate feasibility or efficiency of
their contributions. However, finding the right benchmark suite can be a
daunting task - existing benchmark suites may be outdated, known to be flawed,
or simply irrelevant for the proposed approach. Creating a proper benchmark
suite is challenging, extremely time consuming, and also - unless it becomes
widely popular - a thankless endeavor. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach to help researchers find relevant workloads for their experimental
evaluation needs. Our approach relies on the huge number of open-source projects
available in public repositories, and on unit testing having become best
practice in software development. Using a repository crawler employing pluggable
static and dynamic analyses for filtering and workload characterization, we
allow users to automatically find projects with relevant workloads. Preliminary
results presented here show that unit tests can provide a viable source of
workloads, and that the combination of static and dynamic analyses improves the
ability to identify relevant workloads that can serve as the basis for custom
benchmark suites.</p>
